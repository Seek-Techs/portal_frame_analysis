## üìç 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either **"Rock"** or **"Mine"** based on the frequency responses collected by a sonar device. It is a binary classification problem involving pattern recognition and signal analysis, often used as a benchmark in machine learning.

## üìä 2. Dataset Description

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì [Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))
- **Instances**: 208
- **Features**: 60 numerical attributes (continuous), representing energy within frequency bands.
- **Target**: Binary class label (`M` for Mine, `R` for Rock)

---

## ‚ùì 3. Problem Statement

Can a machine learning model accurately classify sonar signals based on their frequency patterns, distinguishing between rocks and mines with high precision and minimal error?

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Data Preprocessing

- **Loading the data**: Read from CSV using `pandas`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Explored data shape and class distribution.
- **Label Encoding**:
  - Converted `M` (Mine) and `R` (Rock) into binary numerical values.
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Used `StandardScaler` to normalize the feature values to improve model performance.

---

## ü§ñ 6. Model Building

- **Model Used**: `Linear Algorithms and Nonlinear Algorithms`
  - Logistic Regression (LR) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
  - Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Trained on scaled data.

- **Train-Test Split**:
  - 80% training, 20% testing, with a fixed random state for reproducibility.

---

## üìà 7. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics Used**:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- **Results**:
  - High accuracy achieved on both training and test datasets.
  - Confusion matrix indicated strong separation between classes.

## üèÅ 8. Final Results

| Dataset       | Accuracy (%) |
|---------------|--------------|
| Training Set  | ~100%        |
| Test Set      | ~86%         |

- **Observations**:
  - Slight overfitting may be present.
  - Model performs well, but additional tuning or models may improve test performance.

## üßæ 9. Conclusion and Recommendations

The Extra Trees (ET) algorithm demonstrated the most promise based on our ensemble comparison, achieving the highest mean accuracy on the standardized dataset and exhibiting relatively low variance.

## ‚úÖ 10. Achieved Enhancements and Future Prospects

This project integrates several advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and model robustness:

- ‚úÖ **Advanced Classifiers Implemented**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), CART, KNN, and NB were trained and evaluated.
- ‚úÖ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV was used to optimize key parameters for improved model performance.
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation (k=10) ensured robust performance evaluation and mitigated overfitting.
- Enssemble methods: Two boostings and bagging methods

### üî≠ Future Work
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., simple neural networks with Keras or PyTorch).
- Implement SHAP or LIME for model interpretability and explainable AI.
- Deploy the final model as a web application using **Streamlit**, **Flask**, or **FastAPI**.
